This is the first course in Analysis in the Bachelor program at
Ecole Polytechnique. The objective is to present the fundamental notions and results concerning the sets of real and complex numbers, real-valued and complex-valued sequences and infinite series, as well as the continuity and differentiability of functions of a real variable. Although this
course follows naturally from studentsâ€™ previous studies in mathematics, it also marks a transition towards greater rigor and proof-based reasoning. While students are expected to have some prior knowledge, we take a systematic approach, offering insights into the foundations of Analysis and rigorously proving all key results.
